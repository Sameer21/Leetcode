# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to LeetCode problems that I solve for coding interview preparation and algorithm practice. The solutions are organized by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) and also grouped by topics like arrays, strings, trees, graphs, and dynamic programming for easy reference.

I try to solve at least one problem daily and document my approach with clean, well-commented code. Each solution includes the problem description, my solution approach, and time/space complexity analysis. Currently working through the Blind 75 list and popular interview questions.

The code is primarily written in Python and Java. Feel free to browse through the solutions if you're preparing for coding interviews or just want to see different approaches to algorithmic problems.
